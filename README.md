# ABOUT_ME
# 👋 Hey, I’m Navin Khumar  

I’m a **final-year ECE student** at Sri Eshwar College of Engineering, passionate about building solutions that connect **software, networking**
Over the past few years, I’ve explored multiple domains:
- ⚡ Configured and troubleshooted **enterprise networks** during my **Networking Internship at Thiran Hub**.  
- 🔐 Monitored and analyzed **security threats** during my **Cybersecurity Internship at NSIC**.  
- 🌐 Built **full-stack web apps** with the MERN stack, including my project **[ThinkBoard](https://thinkboard-seven.vercel.app/)** – a collaborative digital whiteboard.  

I love **problem solving** – whether it’s cracking 170+ problems on CodeChef, exploring algorithms in DSA, or automating workflows with Python.
